# js-game

This is my first attempt at a game using JavaScript. I needed a project where I could use more key concepts of JS and see them in work.

This game uses the left and right arrow keys in order to move the car left and right. This is to ensure that the car does not crash into the given
obstacle in the way. This has been very fun to make.

As of right now, the game is working, but it does not look visually appealing. The same goes with the code. There is a lot of code that has been commented
out due to testing. Once the code is cleaned up, I will update the README file.
